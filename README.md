# CardiovascularPredictor
A simple neural netowork that looks at certain health features of people, including their age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose etc.. and predicts their chances of having a cardiovascular disease.
 
 This is the first neural network I have ever devolped without the outside help. It doesnt have extraordinary results but I learned a lot while tweaking the structure of the network. After a lot of trial and error, it can predict if a certain person has a cardiovascular disease with 70% accuracy. That accuracy is not enough to really be significant but I hope to look back at this project when I am more experienced and improve the accuracy.
